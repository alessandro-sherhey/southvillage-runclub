This is the last project you find just before completing the "Making a Website Responsive" section in the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path, 
in the Codecademy website. I decided to recreate their example website with a similar design, and I added some new features, like dark mode and rounded
corners for images. I'm open for any suggestions on how to improve this!

**Note:** As I wrote in the website, **all images are property of Codecademy**. I just downloaded and reused them to make this new version of
the website.
